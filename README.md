# Neighborhood Map

This project shows the locations of all the Train Stations in Almere. It uses
the Google Maps API to show the locations on a map. The user can select a
location and see close places of interest. The project also allows the user
to filter the locations that can be selected.

## Running the application

Open index.html in a browser.

## Adding new locations

If in the future new Train stations are built in Alemere feel free to add them
in the `locations` variable in the `js/neighborhoodMap.js` file. A further
improvement could be getting these either from a Data Base or from a 3rd party
API.

## Framworks and Libraries

* JQuery
* Knockout JS

## 3rd party APIs

* FourSquare

## Code that was used/modified
